Education
======
* B.S. in Biological Science, University of Florence, Florence (Italy), 2010-2013
* M.S. in Molecular and Celluar Biology, University of Florence, Florence (Italy), 2013-2015
* Ph.D in Biology, University of Luxembourg, Esch sur Alzette (Luxembourg), 2015-2019

Work experience
======
* 07/2013 – 09/2013: **Trainee** [Laboratorio Di Evoluzione Microbica E Molecolare](https://www.bio.unifi.it/cmpro-v-p-153.html) University of Florence, Florence (Italy).

  The focus of my bachelor thesis was to model the microbial metabolism of organisms important for
bioremediation and experimentally test *in silico* predictions. The final aim was the *in silico* study of
possible strategies for microbial engineering.

  * The work during my internship included:
    * Constraint-based modeling applied to microbial metabolism (Flux Balance Analysis)
    * Basic microbiological wet lab techniques
    * Microbiology applied to bioremediation
  * Supervisors: Prof. Renato Fani & Dr. Marco Fondi 

* 02/2015–10/2015: **Trainee** [Molecular Systems Physiology Group](https://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb) University of Luxembourg (Luxembourg center for Systems Biology), Esch sur Alzette (Luxembourg).
  * The work during my internship included:
    * Constraint-based metabolic modeling
    * Agent-based modeling
    * Gut Physiology
    * Microbial ecology
    * Programming (R and MATLAB)
  * Supervisors: Prof. Ines Thiele

* 12/2015 – 11/2019: **PhD student & Visiting PhD student** [Molecular Systems Physiology Group](https://www.thielelab.eu/) University of Luxembourg (Luxembourg center for Systems Biology), Esch sur Alzette (Luxembourg) & National University Of Ireland, Galway (Ireland).

  The focus of my PhD was the study of how environmental factors such as nutrition and the human gut
microbiota composition, impact human health. These factors are crucial to understanding the
pathogenesis of complex diseases, such as Parkinson's Disease. The integration of a systems biology
computational modeling approach termed constraint-based modeling with experimental data
(metagenomics), together with the deployment of advanced statistical techniques (machine learning),
helps to elucidate the role played by these environmental factors.

  * The work during my PhD included:
    * Studying the influence of the human gut microbiota in Parkinson's Disease
    * Constraint-based modeling of microbial gut communities
    * Metagenomic analysis
    * Development of the MATLAB [Microbiome Modeling Toolbox](https://git.io/microbiomeModelingToolbox)
    * Machine learning analysis applied to biological datasets
    * Teaching experience at the university
    * Scientific dissertation (poster presentation in international conferences, talks, paper submission)
  * Supervisor: Prof. Ines Thiele 

* 12/2019 – 01/2020: **Postdoctoral researcher / Research associate** [Clinical & Experimental Neurosciences Group](https://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb/research/clinical_experimental_neuroscience) University of Luxembourg (Luxembourg center for Systems Biology), Esch sur Alzette (Luxembourg).
  * Principal Investigator: Prof. Rejko Krüger

* 02/2020 – present: **Postdoctoral scientist** [Korem Lab](https://www.koremlab.science/) Columbia University in the city of New York, New York City (NY)

  The focus of my postdoc is the study of how l factors.

  * Current research includes:
    * Item 1
    * Item 2
    * Metagenomic analysis
  * Principal Investigator: Dr. Tal Korem
