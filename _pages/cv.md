  The focus of my bachelor thesis was to model the microbial metabolism of organisms important for
bioremediation and experimentally test *in silico* predictions. The final aim was the *in silico* study of
possible strategies for microbial engineering.

  * More specifically the work during my internship included:
    * Constraint-based modeling applied to microbial metabolism (Flux Balance Analysis)
    * Basic microbiological wet lab techniques
    * Microbiology applied to bioremediation
  * Supervisors: Prof. Renato Fani & Dr. Marco Fondi
