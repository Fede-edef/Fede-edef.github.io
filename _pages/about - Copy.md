My name is Federico Baldini and I am a Senior Bioinformatician at [The Bioinformatics for Next Generation Sequencing (BiNGS)](https://bings.mssm.edu/) core facility of the Ichan Scool of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. I am very passionate about computational biology and I like to combine different bioinformatic approaches to process and analyze human and human-derived data aiming at solving complex biological problems.

Scientific Path
======
Before joining BiNGS in April 2024, I obtained a BSc and a MSc in Cellular and Molecular Biology from [The University of Florence](https://www.bio.unifi.it/cmpro-v-p-162.html) in 2015, followed by a PhD in Systems Biology from [LCSB at the University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu/lcsb-en/) in 2019. My PhD dissertation focused on developing new computational modeling methods integrating metabolic modeling and microbial genomics analysis to understand the role of the human gut microbiome in complex diseases ([Baldini et al. Bioinformatics 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty941); [Baldini et al. JOSS 2024](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05545)). I applied these methods to study Parkinson's Disease ([Baldini et al. BMC Biology 2020](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-020-00775-7); [Hertel et al. Cell Reports 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.035)), and gastrointestinal diseases such as Coeliac Disease and Inflammatory Bowel Disease ([Heinken et al. Microbiome 2019](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-019-0689-3)). 

Aftyer my PhD, I held a Postdoctoral Research Scientist position at Columbia University in the Department of Systems Biology for four years (2020-2024). During my postdoc, I used genome-scale metabolic models, statistical and machine learning methods to explore multi-omics data from human samples elucidating the role of the human microbiome in various human conditions and cancer therapy response. Specifically, I have been studying metabolic and microbial alterations in Preterm Birth ([Baldini et al., Nature Microbiology 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-022-01293-8)), Adenocarcinoma ([Solfisburg et al. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2024](https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-23-0652)) as well as microbiome and gut metabolome associations with lymphoma patients survival and treatment response (Baldini et al., in preparation).

During my PhD and Postdoctoral training I acquired a deep expertise in microbial genomics analysis (16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics), metabolic modeling (Flux Balance Analysis), metabolomics, data analysis, and machine learning. 

Currently, at BiNGS I am bulding a strong foundation in human genomics analysis such as trancriptomics (i.e., Bulk RNA-seq, Single Cell RNA-seq) and epigenomics (i.e., ATAC sequencing, Micro-C) analyis. I applay these tools to study different cancer and cancer-related conditions such as human melanoma. 

Scientific Vision
======
I am a firm beliver in equal opprtunities and I am convinced that science should be acessible to everyone. If you are studying biology or bioiformatics, and maybe thinking about a possible career in science, please don't hesitate to reach out! I am still learnning everyday something new about this beautiful scientific world, but I love to share my experience and network.

Non-scientific Interests
======
Outside science I have many other interests. I spend my free time hanging out with friends as well as cooking, practicing sports, reading books, and playing music. I love skiing and playing volleyball as well as playing the clarinet. I also like motorcycles which I have been riding for long and short distance trips. After exploring the beatuful region of Tuscany during my studies in Italy riding my 650 cc motorcycle, currently, with the help of my partner, I am exploring the New York State region! 

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
